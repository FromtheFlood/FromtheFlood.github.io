                    When it comes to microphones for personal use, you really do need to know what you are doing. On this page, I will be going over why getting the most popular microphone might not be the best choice for your personal studio, even though it may have the best sound quality. I will also be talking about a couple of more affordable microphones that will be much more beginner friendly for people just starting to build their first home studio.

                    Let's stop and talk for a minute about the big ol' elephant in the room. Everyone and their mother has seen one of these microphones. From your favorite streamer or big YouTuber, to actual radio stations and professional recording studios, this mic can be found everywhere. Which is the exact reason it isn't for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't get me wrong. The purpose of this website isn't to gatekeep you or try to demoralize you from building your first home studio. In fact, I am actually writing all of this because it is for a school project, and the only people who will ever potentially read this are my group members and the professor who assigned this to us. Maybe if we do well enough we will get used as an example but that is about it.  With that being said though, it is still a really bad idea for someone with no knowledge of microphones, how they work and when to use them to use this particular microphone simply because of how much effort it does in fact take in the long run. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, I will ask a couple of questions here, and if any of these are surprising to you, then it is just further proof of how difficult it actually is to set these up, and even professionals can have hours worth of problems try to set these up and make them work properly. If you're here it's because of a school project as I stated earlier, so it can be safe to assume you have little knowledge of mics, and that's okay, I'm just writing this from the top of my head to make content for this website. Anyways, the Shure SM7B costs around $500 CAD from Amazon.ca. The only thing included in the box at that price point is the microphone itself as well as an additional sock in case you don't want to use the stock one that comes with it. That's it. If you want to be able to use this microphone, you are going to need at least one XLR cable to plug it in to a mixing board. You also cannot cheat here and try to find an XLR cable that will plug directly into your PC, as the mic will sound terrible and it will more likely than not, just not work the way you want it to. On top of the XLR cable(s) you are also going to need either a dynamite stick or a cloudlifter. Essentially these use phantom power (we'll get there) to boost the gain of the mic into levels that are actually usable. The other thing you are going to need for the absolute minimum is an audio interface that can plug into a computer. This needs to have XLR inputs and preferably a built in way to connnect to a computer using a USB cable (if you don't have something like this you are very liable to get ground loops if you don't have other pieces of equipment). So just for the mic, you are looking at another $200 CAD before you can even use that, and that's being generous. Many people aren't aware of this and get upset when they buy the mic and realize they can't use it. There is also a special way that you must speak in to this microphone in order for it to pick your voice up properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I forgot the rest of my questions. Anyways, this section of information seems to be getting a little longer, so let's just say to hold off on this mic until you feel comfortable with microphones and how to use them. Next, I will be going over some much easier to use microphones that can sound quite good once you know how to set them up.

            <h2>Blue Snowball</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The Blue Snowball actually holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first microphone I ever bought for my home studio, way back when I had just started radio school. I bought it so I could use it with my laptop and practice school a little bit while goofing around with mym friends. It is a very good microphone for beginners, as it is a simple small microphone that comes with a USB cable that you can plug right into your PC and use without any hassle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started writing some pros and then figure it might be nicer if both pros and cons had their own paragraph. So we will start with pros. As I said earlier, the Blue Snowball is ready to use right out of the box. All you need is a place to put it. In the box is the microphone, and the cable that you can use to plug it in to your computer. The sound quality is also quite nice, and while it is the worst one on the list out of the box in terms of sound, it still sounds great, and as long as you are using it properly, it can still sound like a professional mic. This is also the cheapest microphone on this list, which makes it a budget friendly mic as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Blue Snowball does have cons as well. For instance, the ball shape of the mic can lead to some issues when it comes to recording sound. The shape actually can deflet sound a bit, so if you are not speaking directly into the mic, the sound might not seem as nice as it could. The stand that it comes with is also a little bit short, so it might be a little awkward if you are looking to place it on your desk. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all, the Blue Snowball microphone is a very good option when deciding if you would like to start your own studio, but you don't quite know if it's something you are going to like or not.

            <h2>Shure MV7</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The Shure MV7 is probably the second best microphone on this list, but it is also the second most expensive. With that being said, it does offer a whole bunch of features that the other two beginner microphones don't have. I don't actually have one of these in my studio because I have three of the SM7B mics and I have been building my studio for the better part of the last decade, however, if these existed when I was first starting out, I would have chesen these over the Blue Snowball. I only used the Snowball for under a year before I decided to move up, and I was considering another Blue mic, but decided against it as I was starting to get into mixing boards at that time. This is the mic I would have chosen for sure in that in-between period if it had been a product back then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This mic has a ton of pros, the first and main one being ease of use. I don't know if this comes in box or not, but this mic can be plugged directly into the computer, or you can send it to a mixing board with the XLR input that is also built in. Now, here I would like to say, if you are planning on plugging directly into your PC I would actually recommend the MV7+ as it is just easier and more optimized for plugging directly into a USB port. Having the XLR slot means that this mic can be used with a full studio or when just starting out. It also looks very sleek and professional as it is just a smaller version of the SM7B. This mic also has the best sound quality of all of the mics we will be talking about today other than the SM7B, and that's because it is made by the same people. Shure is an incredibly reliable brand and this microphone reflects that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not the perfect microphone though, and does have it's fair share of cons. For instance, even though it does have plug and play capabilities, plugging it in via XLR cable to a proper mixing board will of course give a much better sound overall. This is just the nature of microphones, and there is not a whole lot that can be done here. This mic also doesn't come with its own stand, so that is something you will need to buy if you want to use this mic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the Shure MV7 is most likely the best microphone that you can buy for a beginner studio, and it can be used to help learn how to use mixing boards, and set you up to learn more in the future without having to buy a new mic when you get your first board.

            <h2>Blue Yeti</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The Blue Yeti is a highly upgraded version of the Blue Snowball. It is a very pleasant microphone to use, and can be the easiest to set up in order to pick up the noise coming from an entire room instead of a single person. It is another mic that I have not used myself, however I have thought about it in the past, and it is something that I may add to my collection in the future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like all of the beginner microphones on this list, the Blue Yeti can be plugged directly into a computer directly out of the box. It also comes with a stand, so you don't have to worry about finding one before you bring it home. The Blue Yeti also has an improved design over the snowball, so it is much easier to direct the sound into the microphone effectively. I also just like the way it looks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I like this microphone, I don't think it brings as much to the table as the Shure MV7 does. It doesn't have an XLR output, and because of that, the sound quality isn't quite as good. The Yeti is also a little bit awkward to set up using anything that isn't the stand that comes with it, so that, while minor, can absolutely be a problem if you would like to have it closer to your mouth. I'm tired now and don't want to do anymore, so I'm going to hope that this is enough content.

                    In conclusion, don't buy the Shure SM7B if you are new to making a home studio. It will cause you more headaches than it will solve. Also, sorry if that paragraph came off as a little aggressive. I had just finished reading a bunch of one star Amazon reviews from people who just didn't do any research.

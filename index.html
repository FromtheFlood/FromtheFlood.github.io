        <h2>What Are We?</h2>
        <p>
            Incompedia is a completely non-comprehensive "encyclopedia" that covers an intensely tiny amount of topics. The topics we do cover are random and based on the whims of the people who were in the group for this project. From our humble beginnings of no content what-so-ever, to over two topics that we have grown to today, Incompedia Group is dedicated to creating bias, little-researched topics that may or may not be of interest to you.
